Task 2: Cloud Monitoring and Alerts
Abstract
This task focused on implementing monitoring and alerting for an Amazon EC2 instance using AWS CloudWatch. I created a custom CloudWatch alarm that triggers when the CPU utilization surpasses a defined threshold. Additionally, I configured a CloudWatch dashboard to visualize key performance metrics, including CPUUtilization, enabling real-time observability of system health and resource usage. Through this task, I gained practical experience in setting up alerts and dashboards, emphasizing the importance of monitoring and incident response in cloud environments.
